# PSVeeamAudit

PSVeeamAudit is a DSC resource for Veeam backup job management. Have you ever modified a backup job during troubleshooting and forgot to correct the change? Backup job configuration drift can lead to violated SLAs and data loss. This DSC resource allows you to define your jobs once and make sure they stay that way!

This is also a just-for-fun project between a few Freudenberg sysadmins to learn DSC and foster collaboration.
